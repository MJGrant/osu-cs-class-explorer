I did well (at least on the midterm, no final grade yet), but it took a lot of studying and there was some fairly obscure stuff, and a few 'gotchas' that really took understanding the nuances very well.  The programming wasn't bad, but some of the extra credit could be a little tricky.  A lot of people struggled with stuff, I would definitely start early.

The final is rigorous in the sense that there were way too many questions for the time allotted.

The grading is very lenient, just make sure you do the work and put in a little genuine effort.  People made a big deal about induction, but it wasn't that bad.  Weak induction is pretty easy, but there are some tricky things you can do with algebra that aren't taught very well.

I read somewhere that induction is the hardest part of the course, but unfortunately that was not the case for me and many others in the class. Permutation and combinations were very challenging (2nd to last week).\n\nYou'll find that most weeks are challenging since everything is new stuff but then you look back and study for the midterm/final and you're a pro at all the stuff before. Induction becomes fairly simple after a few weeks of letting it sit in your head, so don't sweat it if it's taking you a while to grasp it immediately. \n\nRegarding the lectures, for some weeks they were good and others they weren't. I found them more useful in the beginning , very weak during the middle, and better the last weeks. You'd think the practice problems they go over in the lectures would help you in the HW but for most weeks they don't. Apparently the lectures were made while they were using another textbook.

I don't feel the class is too bad, but there is a lot of info thrown at you, and you need to know a lot.  The projects ramp up in difficulty, with a few easier ones here and there.  If you are having trouble, you really need to start them early as lots of people struggle right up to the end - but you never see many people asking questions earlier in the week.\n\nThe first exam probably differs a lot from what people expect from a computer science exam, and a lot of people did poorly (learn how to trace code, learn the unusual cases and what type of errors there are).  Actually messing with the errors the and warnings the book gives might be good practice. The second exam is a bit more conventional.\n\nThe professor's communication is decent, but he neglects to fully answer questions sometimes, and frequently revises assignment requirements halfway through (again, get started early).  He is also very inflexible considering this is a course partly aimed at people pursuing a second career.\n\nThe book is decent, but has lots of errors.  The course notes are helpful, but also have errors.  The video lectures were practically unwatchable to me (accent, voice, pacing).\n\n\n","timestamp":"November 2015"},{"tip":"Pay attention to details.  Grading is done by running scripts.

The 1st assignment was like a proper lab submission and there was a single graded discussion post and then we just did writeups for the rest of the term. Basically each week there is about 1-2 labs worth of work to complete and then you make a blog post about what you did, what you learned, anything interesting you found and submit a URL to that post. Yeah, that is pretty vague instructions but that's the nature of this class. I would do a writeup of the portion of the lab(s) that I was able to complete for that week and include a bunch of screenshots and commands I used. Sometimes I was not able to get through all of the labs but I still received full credit on my writeups. The Final consisted of recording a ~30 min presentation on a cybersecurity issue of your choice.\n-You get as much out of this class as you want. The professor is a ghost. If you are interested in CyberSecurity you have the opportunity to learn a lot, sort of an intro to many different areas of cybersecurity. If you don't give a shit, you can half-ass the writeups and still do fine. I thought the lectures were very interesting and different from the usual OSU format. They were all guest lecturers, different security professionals, most of whom worked at Intel Security and the videos are of the actual lectures given on campus. As a result, there is quite a lot of lecture video each week (about 1-2 hours) where they discuss the materials as well as go over the labs. I only thought the last one on Mobile Security kinda sucked, the rest I enjoyed. If you are interested in the material, and not OCD anal retentive when it comes to instructions or prompt grading (we received grades only 3 times the whole quarter, in week 8 covering weeks 1-7, week 10 covering weeks 7-9, and the final grade), I think you will enjoy this class because it is a class where you can learn a lot AND that is low stress at the same time. I think that is rare in this program. \n-McGrath is sometimes not clear with his instructions and is stubborn. Ask for clarification on the forums if you don't understand something. Some students may be tempted to offer reasonable suggestions for improvements (such as using a single place to post all course information rather than multiple websites or posting all TEACH submission links at the start of the term). He will not listen to you. Regardless, there is NO POINT in being argumentative with him on Piazza. This class is very easy and all you are doing is poking a sleeping bear. \n-TopHat is the \"textbook\" for this class. It's basically the equivalent of Canvas where videos and assignment due dates are posted. He will not allow students to download the videos. There is no point in paying for the year long access because you won't have access to the Virtual Machines so just choose the cheapest option which was the quarter long access for $60.\n","timestamp":"March 2017"}],"difficulty":[1,0,0,0,0],"timeSpent":[0,1,0,0]},"CS475":{"fullName":"CS 475 - Intro to Parallel Programming","tips":[{"tip":"Have fun and enjoy a class taught by someone who truly cares","timestamp":"June 2017"},{"tip":"The projects are pretty easy just be sure to know the why behind the results.
